# The-Envelope-Problem
You are given two envelopes, one of which contains $100 and the other of which contains $1,000. You do not know which envelope contains which amount of money. You are allowed to choose one envelope, but only one. If you choose the envelope with $100, you will win $100; if you choose the envelope with $1,000, you will win $1,000.

What is the optimal strategy for choosing an envelope?

Solution:

The optimal strategy is to choose the envelope that you have not yet chosen. This is because, regardless of which envelope contains which amount of money, the probability of the envelope that you have not yet chosen containing the larger amount of money is 1/2.
